A simple app that connects frontend (React) and backend (Apache) together to provide a service that takes user-input from a form and pass it to a php file that is connected to a MySQL database. In the database, the user-input will get stored if everything went successfully.

### Do the following steps to setup the app and thus use it at the end. The steps are:-

1- Copy the API folder contents and paste them in your server documents root.

NOTE: If you use XAMPP, then the Apache server path will be: C:\xampp\htdocs

2- Use the terminal (e.g., Hyper terminal) to `cd` to the app folder.

3- Write on the terminal, `npm i` to install the node packages.

4- Make sure your server is turned on. If you use apache server then turned it on through the XAMPP Control Panel.

5- Make a connection in MySQL Workbench according to index.php database configurations.

6- Run your app by writing the command `npm start`.

7- Notice the data inserted in your database. Refresh the table to view them.
