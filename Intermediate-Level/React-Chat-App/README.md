# About

A real-time chat app that uses GraphQL and Nodejs for the server-side, React, and Bootstrap for the client-side. It takes advantage of GraphQL subscriptions to make it in real-time.

# Steps to Run the App

Use your CLI and 

    - clone the project

        `git clone https://github.com/TasneemZh/React-Chat-App.git`

    - install the NPM packages on the frontend and backend

        `cd React-Chat-App\frontend`
        
        `npm i && npm i -D`

        `cd ..`

        `cd backend`

        `npm i && npm i -D`

    - run the server in a separate tab on your terminal

        `node app.js` or `nodemon` (if you have it installed)

    - run the app

        `npm start`
