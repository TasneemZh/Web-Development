A collection of small projects for practicing Nodejs basic concepts, and they are:

### callbacks-map

Simulating the *map* function in javascript which works with arrays. The *map* function is a method for arrays, but here it is merely a function that takes the array as an input.

### query-parameters

Several filters in the URL path to see how query parameters work. Error handling is implemented in the project to guide the user in using the filters effectively and correctly.

### set-and-sort

Implementing the set and sort built-in functions and simulating them in two separate functions. In addition to the two sorting options which are hardcoded for now but can be changed easily to get the result in ascending or descending order.

There is a **bonus** function for finding the second maximum number in an array. This can be related to the sorting since this is what you need to do if it was the *third, fourth, etc* maximum number.
