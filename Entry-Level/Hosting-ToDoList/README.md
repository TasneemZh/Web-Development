The site is published at https://tasneemzh-todolist.herokuapp.com/

HTML + CSS + JavaScript + EJS + Node.js + Express + MongoDB

-----------------

You can open the site through your local server on 3000 port by typing:

- the URL: http://localhost:3000/ and http://localhost:3000/[any-parameter]

**and** 

- `nodemon (app.js)` on your HyperTerminal

NOTE: Specifying *app.js* after *nodemon* is **optional** since it is determined to be the main file in *package.JSON*

-----------------

You can replace the connection with *MongoDB Atlas* with yours by making an account on MongoDB Atlas (For more details, see app.js comments and [the reference](https://www.mongodb.com/try?jmp=nav) at the end)

Your changes take effect on your local server but not the site unless you deploy your git on Heroku after making an account on Heroku.

NOTE: If not interested in deploying the project remotely, then check this one: [To-Do-List App](https://github.com/TasneemZh/To-Do-List)

-----------------

Make sure to:

1- create a site on Heroku to deploy your project on it by typing: `heroku create [your-site-name]`

2- update your local repository on Git (type on HyperTerminal: `git add .` THEN `git commit -m "[your message]"`)

3- push your local repository to the remote repository of your Heroku (type on HyperTerminal: `git push heroku [master]`)

NOTE: The branch could be any other name than *master*, type your local branch name if that is the case

I also heard there are awesome and useful notes at [.gitignore](https://github.com/TasneemZh/Hosting-ToDoList/blob/main/.gitignore), so what are you waiting for? Go and take a quick look
