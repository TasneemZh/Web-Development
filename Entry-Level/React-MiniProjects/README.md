HTML + CSS + JavaScript + Node.js + React

### Use the HyperTerminal to enter the server of each one of the six projects by:

- Moving to the directory where you cloned the main project **React-MiniProjects** (Use cd)

- Using `cd [project-name]` to move one more into one of the six projects

- Installing the required NPM packages in *package.JSON* by typing `npm i`

NOTE: You won’t need to do the third bulleted step if *node_modules* directory wasn’t in the *gitignore* file

- Running the website by typing `npm start`

The last step will automatically open the url: http://localhost:3000/
