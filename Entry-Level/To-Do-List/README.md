NOTE: **don't do the first bulleted step if you have installed nodemon before**

- Installing nodemon by typing `npm install -g nodemon` (Wherever you want^^)

- **(Optional)** Typing `mongo` in another separate tab to interact with the database itself

- Moving to the directory where you cloned the project (Use cd)

NOTE: Specifying *app.js* after *nodemon* is **optional** since it is determined to be the main file in *package.JSON*
